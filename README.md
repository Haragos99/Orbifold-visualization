# Orbifold-visualization
Computer Graphics subject homework
Ray tracing task on GPU and create the Orbifold visualization.
Homwork description:
Create a ray tracing program that displays a dodecahedron room in a sphere of radius âˆš3 m. The room contains an optically smooth golden object defined by an implicit equation f(x,y,z)=exp(ax^2+by^2-cz)-1 cut into a !
sphere of radius 0.3 m in the center of the room and a point source of light. The walls of the room from the corner to 0.1 m are of diffuse-specular type, with portals opening onto another similar room, but rotated 72 degrees about the center of the wall and mirrored onto the plane of the wall. The light source does not shine through the portal, each room has its own light source. The portals can be stepped through a maximum of 5 times during the display. The virtual camera faces the centre of the room and rotates around it. The refractive index and extinction coefficient of the gold: n/k: 0.17/3.1, 0.35/2.7, 1.5/1.9 The other parameters can be chosen individually to make the image beautiful. a,b,c are positive non-integer numbers.
